          <h2><a href="/dexie-cloud">Dexie Cloud</a></h2>
          <p>
            This is our flagship product that completes Dexie.js by taking care of all the complexity around data
            synchronization,
            authentication and access permissions. It makes it easier to build apps, offloads the network and
            improves the user experience.
            Dexie Cloud is available either as installable software or cloud service.

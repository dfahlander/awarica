title: Support Ukraine
---

Hi, I'm David, the author of Dexie.js and I'm from Sweden. I hereby take a stand against Putin's illegal and horrible, unprovoked war under **false flag** against his brother country Ukraine!

Millions of innocent civilians have been tortured, scared to death and have had to flee their country.

**Russia is invading another country.** This is the fact. **And no one has threatened Russia!**

If Ukraine had not been invaded, its democratic and economical growth would be a 'dangerous' example of how a country can bloom. What good would a corrupt leadership like Kreml be then? **Russia could also bloom, get the freedom, democracy and end of its corruption.** And this might be the real reason for starting the war - to keeping own power instead of caring about the citisens' wealth, and lying to people that the west is after them.

The world is watching this awful war with disgust.

# Open Source is about freedom, democracy and peacefulness

We want to live in a world where people are free. Open source community incarnates that spirit. The spirit of democracy, freedom and peacefulness. The opposite of all this is authoritarianism. An attack on a democratic country under false flag is an attack of all of us who want's to live in a free spirit. This is a battle between good and evil. Between openess and closeness. Between democracy and authoritarianism. Between peace and war.

In the end, freedom, goodness and democracy will win.

Awarica AB is a Sweden-based development company dedicated to crafting innovative solutions for app developers. David Fahlander serves as the founder and CEO of Awarica AB.

With a background in computer science and a passion for technology, David, a true entrepreneur with great creativity, diligently worked to establish Awarica as a provider of software tools and services. He founded the company in 2011 with a plethora of ideas on how to streamline the work of developers and significantly enhance apps.

In addition to his contributions at Awarica, David has a rich history of innovation in the tech field. Notably, in 1998, while at the Swedish company WM Data (now Logica), David invented and developed one of the first SSL VPNs in the world.

David was also active in the Commodore 64 scene in the 90's under the alias [daw](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=440), where he was a demo coder and musician, members of the groups Triad and Censor Design.

David's journey with Awarica began with a vision to simplify app development and empower developers with powerful yet user-friendly tools. This vision led to the creation of [Dexie.js](/dexie), an open-source project initiated and led by David, which gained recognition for its simplicity and efficiency in data management.

Under David's leadership, Awarica has steadily grown and achieved a leading position with Dexie.js. Dexie.js has become a staple in its field of libraries for app developers.

With the launch of Dexie Cloud on March 27, 2024, Awarica continues to innovate and revolutionize app development even further. Dexie Cloud offers a comprehensive solution for data storage and synchronization, designed to streamline the app development process and enhance user experiences.
